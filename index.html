          <h2>BBQ Ribs</h2>
          <p>Ingredients: <ul>
    <li>Pork ribs. You can use either spare ribs or baby back ribs for this recipe.</li>
    <li>Apple juice.</li>
    <li>Salt.</li>
    <li>Smoked paprika.</li>
    <li>Garlic powder.</li>
    <li>Tomato ketchup.</li>
    <li>Worcestershire sauce.</li>
    <li>Cider vinegar / Balsamic vinegar.</li>
    <li>Brown sugar.</li>
  </ul>

          <p>Instructions: <h1>HOW TO MAKE BBQ RIBS</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Season and bake: These ribs are baked until tender before transferring to the grill to finish. To prepare the ribs, make sure the silver skin/membrane on the back of the racks of ribs has been removed (your butcher can do this for you). If it hasn’t, it’s easy to do yourself. Loosen the skin with a knife until you can grab it with a piece of paper towel. Pull the membrane off and discard. Combine the salt, sugar, smoked paprika, garlic and onion powder then generously season the ribs on both sides. Place in two baking dishes or foil trays. Pour in the apple juice, cover with foil and place in the oven. Allow to bake for 2½-3 hours or until the ribs are tender.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Make the barbecue sauce: Combine the tomato ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, sugar, salt, smoked paprika and garlic powder in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes until the sauce is thick and smooth and the sugar has dissolved. Allow to cool to room temperature.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Grill and glaze: Once the ribs are tender, remove from the oven and set aside while you prepare the grill. Preheat the grill for at least 5 minutes. Heat should be medium-high as you don’t want the barbecue sauce to burn before the ribs are glazed. Brush the ribs with the barbecue sauce then place on the grill. Allow to cook for 4-5 minutes per side, brushing the ribs regularly with the barbecue sauce to allow the sauce to glaze and create almost a shellac coating on the ribs. You want them to be super sticky and glossy. Remove the ribs from the grill, allow to rest for 5 minutes then slice and serve.</p>
